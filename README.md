# Running the Project

The project consists of **two separate applications**.

Open **two PowerShell terminals**.

---

## Terminal 1 — Hand Tracking

Open a terminal inside the project folder.

```powershell
cd Virtual-Steering-Wheel-Game
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py src/main.py
```

This launches:

- Webcam
- Hand Tracking
- Virtual Steering Wheel

---

## Terminal 2 — Driving Game

Open another terminal inside the same project folder.

```powershell
cd Virtual-Steering-Wheel-Game
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py game/main.py
```

This launches the driving game.
